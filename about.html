  <div class="intro">
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), 2nd Year,
      from Indore. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity for how data
      and intelligent systems can transform the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term vision is to become a highly skilled AI Engineer specializing
      in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP.

      <h3>Foundation in C Programming</h3>
      <p>
        My journey began with C programming, where I developed strong logical
        thinking, memory management understanding, and problem-solving ability.
        This phase built the core foundation of my computer science knowledge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Data Structures & OOPS</h3>
      <p>
        I implemented stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, searching and
        sorting algorithms. Learning OOPS helped me understand abstraction,
        encapsulation, inheritance, and modular code design.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Database Management & SQL</h3>
      <p>
        I learned SQL for structured data handling, including writing complex
        queries, joins, aggregations, and normalization concepts. This helped me
        understand how real-world applications efficiently store and manage data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Frontend Development – HTML & CSS</h3>
      <p>
        I built responsive web pages using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout
        structuring, styling, and user-friendly design principles. As a practical
        project, I developed a complete School Website that included sections
        like homepage, about, admissions, and contact pages. The project enhanced
        my understanding of UI design, structure planning, and real-world website
        deployment basics.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Transition to Python & Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        I moved to Python for its power in data analysis and AI development.
        I gained hands-on experience with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation,
        preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Machine Learning Projects – Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction</h3>
      <p>
        I built a Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction model using real-world dataset
        analysis. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering,
        regression modeling, and performance evaluation using metrics like
        MAE and RMSE. The final model improved prediction accuracy and helped
        simulate how intelligent systems optimize delivery operations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Deep Learning & Advanced AI</h3>
      <p>
        Currently exploring Neural Networks, activation functions, backpropagation,
        optimization techniques, and model tuning. My next focus areas include
        Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing for building scalable,
        intelligent systems.
