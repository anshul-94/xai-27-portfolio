    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), 2nd Year,
      from Indore. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity for how data
      and intelligent systems can transform the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term vision is to become a highly skilled AI Engineer specializing
      in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP.

      <h3>Foundation in C Programming</h3>
      <p>
        My journey began with C programming, where I developed strong logical
        thinking, memory management understanding, and problem-solving ability.
        This phase built the core foundation of my computer science knowledge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Data Structures & OOPS</h3>
      <p>
        I implemented stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, searching and
        sorting algorithms. Learning OOPS helped me understand abstraction,
        encapsulation, inheritance, and modular code design.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Transition to Python & Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        I moved to Python for its power in data analysis and AI development.
        I gained hands-on experience with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation,
        preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Machine Learning Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I explored regression, classification, feature engineering, and model
        evaluation techniques. I built a Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction Model,
        applying real-world dataset analysis and performance optimization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Deep Learning & Advanced AI</h3>
      <p>
        Currently exploring Neural Networks, activation functions, backpropagation,
        and model tuning. My next focus areas include Computer Vision and
        Natural Language Processing for building scalable intelligent systems.
