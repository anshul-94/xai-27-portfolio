  <div class="intro">
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), 2nd Year
      from Indore. My academic journey is driven by deep curiosity about how data
      and intelligent systems can transform real-world problems into scalable solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term vision is to become a highly skilled AI Engineer specializing
      in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

      <h3>Foundation in C Programming</h3>
      <p>
        My journey began with C programming, where I developed strong logical
        thinking, memory management understanding, and structured problem-solving skills.
        This phase built the core foundation of my computer science knowledge.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:2;">
      <h3>Data Structures & Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>
        I implemented stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, and sorting algorithms.
        Learning object-oriented programming helped me understand abstraction,
        encapsulation, inheritance, and modular system design.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:3;">
      <h3>Database Management & SQL</h3>
      <p>
        I learned SQL for structured data handling, including joins, aggregations,
        subqueries, and normalization concepts. This strengthened my understanding
        of how applications efficiently store and retrieve data.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:4;">
      <h3>Frontend Development – HTML & CSS</h3>
      <p>
        I built responsive web pages using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout design,
        styling, and user experience. As a practical project, I developed a complete
        School Website including homepage, about, admissions, and contact sections,
        enhancing my understanding of real-world UI structure and deployment basics.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:5;">
      <h3>Transition to Python & Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        I transitioned to Python for data analysis and AI development. I gained
        hands-on experience with NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning, preprocessing,
        feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:6;">
      <h3>Machine Learning Journey</h3>
      <p>
        After building a strong foundation, I moved into Machine Learning to solve
        real-world problems. I worked on multiple regression and classification models,
        compared algorithms, applied feature engineering, and optimized model performance.
        A key project was a Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction system, where I analyzed
        real-world datasets to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="timeline-item" style="--i:7;">
      <h3>Deep Learning & Advanced AI</h3>
      <p>
        Currently exploring Neural Networks, activation functions, backpropagation,
        optimization techniques, and model tuning. My next focus areas include
        Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to build scalable intelligent systems.
