<h1>EPS School Management System</h1>

<h2>Website Overview</h2>
<p>
The EPS School Management System is a complete dynamic school website
designed to digitally manage student and administrative activities.
The home page provides essential school information, class timetable access,
photo gallery, and important notices managed by the admin.
Students and parents can submit inquiries through a Contact Us form.
</p>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p>
The system consists of two main panels: Student Panel and Admin Panel.
The backend is connected with database management for storing user data,
notices, contacts and student performance details.
</p>

<h2>Student Panel Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secure Login System</li>
<li>Profile View & Update</li>
<li>School AI Chatbox for guidance</li>
<li>Access to timetable and notices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Admin Panel Features</h2>

<li><strong>Manage Notices:</strong> Add, edit, delete notices displayed on main website.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Students:</strong> Update, delete or manage student profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Student Result Prediction:</strong> ML-based prediction system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machine Learning Model (Student Result Prediction)</h2>
<p>
A classification model was implemented to predict whether a student will PASS or FAIL.
The prediction is based on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Attendance Percentage</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Daily Study Hours</li>
<li>Previous Year Marks</li>
</ul>

<p>
The model uses supervised learning techniques. Data preprocessing,
feature selection and model evaluation were applied before deployment.
The system provides binary classification output: PASS or FAIL.
</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)</li>
<li>Database Integration</li>
</ul>
